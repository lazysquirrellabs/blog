# Step 1: Basic shape generation

This step is responsible for generating the polygon that will server as a basic shape for the terrain. In order words, how the terrain will look like from a high up, top view. 

## Supported shapes

- Equilateral triangle.
- Any regular (equilateral and equiangular) polygon, from 4 to 10 sides.

### Equilateral triangle

Generating an equilateral triangle is trivial: create 3 vertices equally distant from the center of the terrain. Each pair forms a 60Â° angle with the center.

{:align="center"}

### Any regular polygon

All other regular polygons (independent of the number of sides) will be generated using the same strategy. We take advantage of the fact that regular polygons can be created by composing triangles and define all polygon generation based on it. Regular polygons are perfect for this task because their vertices are equidistant from the polygon's center.

ðŸ’¡ Although it is possible to generate polygons with any number of sides using this strategy, the number of sides is limited to 10.

#### Square

A square can be created by overlapping 2 isosceles, right-angled triangles on their hypotenuses. The triangles are created in a similar manner to the equilateral triangles described above, but vertices are recycled to save memory. A square contains 4 vertices and 2 triangles.

#### Pentagon

A pentagon can also be created using triangles, but differently from the strategies described above. A vertex is placed on the center of the pentagon and it's used by all triangles that compose the polygon. All other vertices are equidistant from the center vertex. Once again, vertices are recycled to save memory.

#### Other regular polygons

Other regular polygons with more than 5 sides are created using the same strategy as the pentagon's, just increasing the number of vertices. For example, here's a decagon:
