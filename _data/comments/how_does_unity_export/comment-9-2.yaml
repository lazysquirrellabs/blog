  For Unity, check its “features” page: [https://unity3d.com/unity](https://unity3d.com/unity) and its documentation: [https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html)

  For Unreal, check [https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/features](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/features) for features and [https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/index.html](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/index.html)

  I’ve never used Coco2d-x and Stencil much, but you can probably just check their website and read a lot about it.
