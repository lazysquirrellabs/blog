message: 'Thank you for your post! I want to write a little game, just to play a bit in app development (I´m still stuck on desktop in my job) and so I try to choose a technology, that exports to ios, android and my dear legacy, dying out windows phone. I thought about doing a little web app until I fount out that unity isn´t only a game engine, but a real development platform. Was really curious about how it works… I think I´ll give it a try!'
