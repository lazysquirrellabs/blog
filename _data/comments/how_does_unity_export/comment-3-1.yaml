message: Hi Jashan, thank you for the comment. The article lacks this information, indeed. I tried to focus only on the scripting portion, thus the limited content. Your comment showed me what some people could’ve wondered when using Unity that I didn’t at the time I wrote this article. I’ll look some content up about and update it later so it’s more complete. Thank you again.
