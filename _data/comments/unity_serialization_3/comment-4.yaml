message: 'Great Article. Thoroughly clear and well written. Thank you! I am an old man, and am only starting to code now in Unity, so apologies if this is a dumb question. I have a need for database style binary repository to record into and retrieve shot options from (ID, transform (position,rotation) and force). There will be thousands of these entries. These items, like a database, should be changeable values at run-time as better solutions are plotted Simple outcome based learning), I also want to extend it over time (store more values in it, not new fields, so the structure is static). Is serialization the answer? Will a binary or text file be better? Is a text file even savable on Android and Apple IOS? I am only looking for the right suitable solution approach. Thanks again for this in any case.'
