  Oh, Thank you!  
  Also, how can i make “global” variables? I want to create a serializable list with Characters, but i don’t know how to access that list from other scripts. I noticed that when i create 2 gameObjects with the same script the lists get duplicated instead of overriden, i want it to be only one list so i can access it from any script. Again, sorry if i’m not being clear.
