  Thank you for the comment!

  I’m not sure if I got your question right, let me know if I didn’t.

  What I understood was “do I need to create a `GameObject` in the scene in order to use a `ScriptableObject`?”. If that was the question than no. You don’t need to attach a `ScriptableObject` to a `GameObject` (like `MonoBehaviours`).
  Even though, instantiating a `ScriptableObject` isn’t as trivial as a custom class. You must use the `ScriptableObject.CreateInstance` method instead of a regular constructor. Was that your question?
