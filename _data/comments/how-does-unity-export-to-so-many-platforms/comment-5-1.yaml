  Hi Jessica

  Indeed, Unity has become more than a game engine, but most of its architecture still focus on interactive experiences. You can surely do a lot with it, but make sure youâ€™re using the right tools. Maybe thereâ€™s another tool out there that is way more suitable for your purpose. Iâ€™m not an app developer, so I canâ€™t help you much with itâ€¦ but itâ€™s worth googling a bit about it.

  Anyway, Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re looking into app development and Unity by yourself. Maybe you get interested about game development too ðŸ™‚

  Thanks for the comment.
