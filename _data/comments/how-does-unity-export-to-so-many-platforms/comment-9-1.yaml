  Hi,

  Most of this info about each engine is publicly available out there, usually on the own engines’ website, and I’d risk and say that even on Wikipedia pages. If not, you can just Google each aspect for each engine individually. It will really depend on how deep you want to go on each section (graphics by itself can take your entire word count).

  Furthermore, I’m not quite sure what your instruction meant with “processors”, “storage” and “platform interfaces”, but you probably know what they mean.

  I hope I helped,
