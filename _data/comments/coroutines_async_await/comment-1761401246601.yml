  Great post. I especially appreciate the description of differing mindsets on
  async between game dev and business because that's the whole reason I ended up
  here. Async was confusing me because I'm just trying to fire and forget stuff
  like Unreal Engine's Timer class but every example on async is sitting there
  waiting.
