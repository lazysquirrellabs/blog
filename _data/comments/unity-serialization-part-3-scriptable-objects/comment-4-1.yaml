  Hi Telecaster. Thank you for the comment. Sorry for taking so long to reply, I was on vacation.
  
  Serialization is definitely an answer for your problem, specifically ScriptableObjects. They’re perfect to just store and manipulate some data. Another option would be using actual database solutions, like SQLite. I haven’t used it in depth before, but it definitely works. A quick “sqlite unity” Google search might help you.
  
  I am not aware, though, about the advantages and disadvantages of each method and unfortunately I lack free time to help you with that. If you find some info, please share it here, I’d love to learn about it.
